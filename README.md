Installation and Navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
 Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of the installation and navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Installation of VS Code:
   - Describe the steps to download and install Visual Studio Code on Windows 11 operating system. Include any prerequisites that might be needed.
   > Prior to installing VS Code, I ensured that I had a good internet connection to download the software as well as ensuring that I had the sufficient hardware requirements to download VS Code. I visited this site: https://code.visualstudio.com and navigated to my OS then downloaded the software. I then installed and launched the software for use. 

2. First-time Setup:
   - After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.
   > The first thing I did was to change my colour theme. Something I really want out of my coding environment is to have it be visually appealing. This is the main reason I would use Jupyter Notebook instead of VS Code during my academic career. So being able to change my theme is a luxury I really appreciate, although I wish it had more themes to choose from. I went to 'Color theme' under preferences and chose the Dark theme. An extension I installed was Rainbow CSV for its colourful nature, it makes reading large CSV files with many columns easy to read. I also installed GitLens and GitHub Pull Requests to improve my Git experience while using VS Code. As explained, I really like the themes in Jupyter Notebook but what VS Code lacks in themese makes up for in beautiful code format because of Prettier, an extension I installed for the visual appeal.  

3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.
   > -- Activity Bar: Contains icons for different activities like Explorer, Search, Source Control, and Extensions.
     -- Side Bar: Provides views like Explorer (file browser), Search, Source Control (Git integration), and Extensions.
     -- Editor Group: The main area where files are opened for editing.
     -- Status Bar: Shows information about the opened project and Git status.

4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.
   > Accessing Command Palette: Use Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac).
     Examples of Tasks:
     Opening files (Open File)
     Running tasks (Run Task)
     Installing extensions (Install Extensions)

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.
   > Extensions enhance functionality and also ensure that one can intergrate with external services for example, GitHub Pull Requests  allows for a developer to review and manage GitHub Pull Requests directy within VS Code. 
   > Finding and Installing: Access Extensions view in Activity Bar, search for extensions, and click Install.
   > Essential Extensions for Web Development:
     -- Live Server: Local server for live preview.
     -- ESLint: JavaScript linter.
     -- Debugger for Chrome: Debug JavaScript in Chrome.
     -- Prettier: Code formatter.

6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?
   > -- Open terminal with `Ctrl+``.
     -- Execute terminal commands directly within VS Code.
   > Advantages:
     -- Seamless workflow integration.
     -- Avoids switching between editor and external terminal.

7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?
   > Creating: Ctrl+N for new file, Ctrl+Shift+N for new folder.
   > Opening: Use File > Open... or drag files/folders into VS Code.
   > Navigation: Use Side Bar (Explorer) or Ctrl+Tab to switch between open files.

8. Settings and Preferences:
   - Where can users find and customize settings in VS Code? Provide examples of how to change the theme, font size, and keybindings.
   > Customizing:
      -- Finding Settings: File > Preferences > Settings or Ctrl+,.
      -- Examples:
         == Theme: Change via Color Theme.
         == Font Size: Adjust via Editor: Font Size.
         == Keybindings: Customize via Keyboard Shortcuts.

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
   > Setting Up and Starting Debugging:
      -- Configure: Create a launch.json file via Run > Add Configuration....
      -- Start Debugging: Press F5 or click Run > Start Debugging.
   > Key Features:
      -- Breakpoints, Watch variables, Call stack navigation.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
    > Initialize Repository: Git: Initialize Repository in Source Control view.
    > Commit Changes: Stage changes via +, enter commit message, and Ctrl+Enter to commit.
    > Push to GitHub: ... next to branch name, Push.
